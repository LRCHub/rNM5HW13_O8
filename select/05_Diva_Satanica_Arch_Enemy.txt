Divine queen of evil
Sowing her seeds of hate
Mistress of pain
Diva satanica, master of temptation

Medusa, abuser
Both beast and beauty
Seducer, she'll use you
Bring you to your knees

Blinded by her infinite beauty
You are lured into the temple
The smell of incense burning
This carnal pleasure yearning

Bride of Satan
Transgress the rules of this world
Too late you realize
This love is ripping you apart

Medusa, abuser
Both beast and beauty
Seducer, she'll use you
As fodder for her dreams

Drinking the blood, eating the flesh
She's getting high on you
Watching you die gives her a thrill
There is always more blood to spill
