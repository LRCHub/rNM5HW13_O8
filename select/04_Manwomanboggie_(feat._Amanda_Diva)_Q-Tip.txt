Get down
(Make it easy)
Good God, make it easier now
(Good God, make it easier now)

Get down
(Man and woman, get down)
Good God, make it easier now
(Good God, make it easier now)

Get down
(Man and woman get down)
A dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, duh, doo

Man and woman be patrollin' the earth
Puttin' shit in the game
Citizens of the world, we runnin' out
Precious time is a grain of sand

Ignored by the hand
(Work hard man everyday)
Work hard man everyday
(For who?)
For another man's plan

Man orders woman when he come home
Get your ass in the air
(My woman wants it just as much as I do)
Woman wants it just as much as he does
But makes as if she don't care

Man and woman in this thing where I'm from
Be havin' things on their mind
Minimum wage and the internet page
(She cry)
Protect themselves from crime

The bluest collar on the brownest of skin
White, yellow, red too
They don't care who it is, they watchin' you

Conspiracies so you might as well dance
Gettin' down, Zulu
Man, woman, yeah, you might as well dance
Gettin' down, Zulu
C'mon, c'mon

Gettin' down is somethin' between
Woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then
Together we stand

Gettin' down is somethin' between
Woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then
Together we stand

Men and women what's goin on inside our minds
Oh, no, sing it one more time, c'mon

Gettin' down is somethin' between
Woman and man
One minute we're so far apart and then
Together we stand

Check it out
Red man was the first on the continent
This you gotta understand
Woman not behind him, she's right beside him there
And they both toil land

White man fightin' for independence from
An old empire
Woman makes a flag for a new nation and
Let's the flag waves high

Black woman is stripped of her kingdom and
Bought the breast feeding new
Black man, mentally, he broke it too
But the cream always rise to the top
That's what men and women do

Man and woman always doin' the dance
One wops, one pops
We'd be lucky if we both found a groove
That we both can lock

Can man be stronger if a woman is there?
I would have to say yes
Can women make it without men being there?
She would have to be blessed

Woman and man are the spiritual forces
Brought together to live
Good thing it's many of us here in the world today
Find a good one to give, let's go, c'mon

Good God, make it easier now
Get down
Good God, make it easier now
Get down
A dooga, dooga, dooga, dooga, duh, doo
Get down
